<b>HC3 Summary</b>
<p> In our research, we found that Niche is the best source for researching a neighborhood due to the breath of info on the site. StreetAdisor came in at a close second for similar reasons, but it gave a lot of weight to first-hand accounts, rather than statistics like Niche. 
  
  We determined that the most desirible aspects to a nieghborhood for constructing affordable housng would be sufficient schooling and childcare options, low crime rates, and affordability in the surrounding area.
  
  St. George ranks at #143 in NYC on Niche, a B+ for public schools, and a C- for safety. On StreetAdviosr, it has a 6.5/10, but ranks high on school quality and affordability.</p>

    Assuming 2 people per bedroom, we estimated that approximately 2898 individuals reside in affordable housing units in St. George. According to data from furmancenter.org, the poverty rate in the St. George/Stapleton area was about 7.0% in 2019, accounting for about 12334 out of 176195 individuals, which is more than five times our estimates. This disparity might be because the .csv file only records affordable housing projects starting as far back as 2014; it is therefore likely that other individuals living in poverty in the St. George area reside in older affordable housing projects. </p>
